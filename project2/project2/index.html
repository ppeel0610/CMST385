    <h1><u>Project Concept</u></h1>
    <p>I will design and develop a coffee shop website that highlights the shop’s menu, atmosphere, and unique offerings while making it easy for customers to place orders, learn about the brand, and stay connected. The primary objective is to create an engaging and user-friendly platform that encourages online orders, boosts foot traffic, and builds customer loyalty. The goals include improving brand visibility, increasing online and in-store sales, and offering convenient access to essential information like location, hours, and seasonal promotions.

The intended audience includes local coffee lovers, remote workers looking for a cozy café to work from, students, and tourists exploring the area. It will also appeal to regulars who want to order ahead or join a loyalty program. </p>
